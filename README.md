# garden-cad
GardenCAD is a local-first, browser-based 2D CAD-style application for planning, documenting, and evolving a garden or property layout with centimeter-level precision. The tool enables users to manually define geometry on a scalable 2D plane, organize them into layers, and accurately measure distances and areas over time.
